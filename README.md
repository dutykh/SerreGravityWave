Serre's equations spectral solver
================

![Head-on collision](/pics/SerreHeadOn.jpg)

This script is a pseudo-spectral solver for the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations which model the propagation of long gravity waves. Here, for the sake of simplicity, we restrict our attention to the case of the flat bottom.

The numerical scheme is described in the following publication:
